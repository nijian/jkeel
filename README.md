## Why jkeel
Building enterprise application is always a challenge for application developers. They have to face tons of new technologies and libraries when programming business logic. Personally, it's not a bad thing if they want to improve their skills in the working process, but, from a team perspective, this is inefficient.

Ideally, in most cases, application developers just need to focus on organizing business logic, e.g. prepare business object model, set up input/output parameters, pick up an algorithm to calculate, use a report engine to export document, search something they want. Do not care about jasper report, elasticsearch, solr, or any underlying tools when writing business logic. This is why jkeel is coming.
